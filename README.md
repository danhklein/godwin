 The original concept for this site was a single use tracker of politian instances of Godwin's Law.

Godwin's Law States that on a long enough timeline of an argument, the chance of someone evoking Hitler increases to 1.0. The correlary is that once Hitler is evoked the argument ends and the evoker loses the argument.
